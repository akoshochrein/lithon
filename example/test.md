# First example lython file
## This function is meant to print hello
```Python
def hello():
    print 'Hello'
```
## It is good to know that you can enter text within the Python code and it will still run.
```Python
def world():
```
Exactly like this
```Python
    print 'World'
```
## Goals
The goal is to have a markdown file and a python file that runs in the end.
```Python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    hello()
    world()
```
